# VoiceFlow

> **Author's Note**: This project has been primarily vibe coded with Claude. It's been fun to code with Claude. Feel free to tear the code apart - submit issues where Claude is good and bad at coding. Feel free to fork it off. I promise it should mostly work on a Windows machine, which is where I've tested it. Feel free to make your own, do what you need to, and hopefully you find it useful to avoid paying for equivalent transcription services (likely better transcription services for more money, but oh well). Do with it as you please, and again feel free to submit any issues. I may or may not ever get to them.

A production-quality voice transcription system for Windows that converts speech to text using state-of-the-art AI models. Features WhisperX integration, speaker diarization, and word-level timestamps. Works offline with no data sent to external servers - your voice data stays completely private.

## What It Does

- Press and hold a hotkey (default: Ctrl+Shift) to record speech
- Automatically transcribes using WhisperX with 70x realtime performance
- Types the transcribed text into whatever application you're using
- Advanced features: speaker diarization, word timestamps, context awareness
- Everything happens locally on your machine - no internet required

## Control Center

![VoiceFlow Control Center](assets/control-center-gui-clean.png)

The Control Center provides system management and monitoring. Launch it with:

```bash
# Windows
tools\launchers\LAUNCH_CONTROL_CENTER.bat

# Or run directly
python tools/VoiceFlow_Control_Center.py
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Windows (tested here, other platforms untested)
- A microphone
- 4GB+ RAM recommended

### Install Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voiceflow.git
cd voiceflow

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Launch with system tray
START_VOICEFLOW.bat

# Or launch terminal mode
LAUNCH_VOICEFLOW.bat
```

### Basic Operation

1. Launch VoiceFlow using one of the methods above
2. Press and hold `Ctrl+Shift` to start recording
3. Speak while holding the keys
4. Release the keys to stop recording and transcribe
5. The transcribed text appears in your active window with intelligent formatting

### Visual Indicators

The system shows status with colored indicators:

- **Blue**: Ready for input
- **Orange**: Recording (while holding hotkey)
- **Green**: Processing/transcribing
- **Red**: Error occurred

## Configuration

Settings can be adjusted through:

- **System Tray**: Right-click the tray icon for basic toggles
- **Configuration Files**: JSON files in the config directory
- **Command Line**: Various startup options available

Common settings:
- Change hotkey combinations
- Switch between typing and clipboard paste
- Toggle "code mode" for programming terms
- Adjust audio devices and quality

## Architecture

The system has four main layers:

1. **UI Layer**: System tray, visual indicators, Control Center GUI
2. **Integration Layer**: Hotkey capture, text injection, system events
3. **Core Processing**: Audio capture, Whisper transcription, text formatting
4. **Hardware Layer**: Audio devices, OS integration, file system

├── integrations/   # System integrations and hotkeys
└── utils/          # Utilities and configuration

Key components:
- `core/asr_production.py`: Production WhisperX transcription engine
- `ui/cli_ultra_simple.py`: Simple production CLI interface
- `ui/enhanced_tray.py`: System tray interface
- `integrations/inject.py`: Text injection system
- `ui/visual_indicators.py`: Status display system
- `voiceflow_fixed.py`: Enhanced CLI with state management and error recovery

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run all tests
pytest

# Quick health check
python scripts/dev/health_check_simple.py

# Stress testing
python tests/stress/test_edge_case_stress.py
```

## Performance

Production performance on modern hardware:
- **Transcription speed**: 70x realtime with WhisperX (vs 10-15x with standard Whisper)
- **Latency**: 50-150ms after key release
- **Memory usage**: 1-3GB depending on model size
- **Accuracy**: Professional-grade with word timestamps and speaker diarization
- **Reliability**: Enhanced error handling with auto-recovery from failures
- Works with or without GPU acceleration

## Recent Improvements (Latest)

✅ **Fixed hanging transcription issue** - Enhanced state management prevents stuck "listening" state
✅ **Production ASR integration** - WhisperX with 70x realtime performance
✅ **Enhanced error handling** - Automatic recovery from audio/transcription failures
✅ **Visual indicator cleanup** - Proper cleanup of persistent notifications
✅ **Smart text formatting** - Intelligent formatting with pause detection and context awareness
✅ **Diagnostic tools** - Comprehensive troubleshooting and testing utilities

## Troubleshooting

**Stuck in "listening" state or persistent notifications**:
```bash
python force_cleanup.py  # Emergency cleanup of visual indicators
python voiceflow_fixed.py  # Use enhanced CLI with auto-recovery
```

**Transcription hanging or not responding**:
```bash
python debug_hang_issue.py  # Diagnostic tool to identify issues
python test_hotkey_issue.py  # Test hotkey and audio systems
```

**Audio not working**:
```bash
python scripts/list_audio_devices.py  # List available microphones
```

**Performance issues**:
- Try smaller Whisper model (`base.en` instead of `large`)
- Check if GPU drivers are installed for CUDA support
- Close other memory-intensive applications

**Permission errors**:
- Run as administrator on Windows
- Check microphone permissions in Windows settings

## Known Issues

- Primarily tested on Windows 11
- May not work well with some applications that block input simulation
- Large Whisper models require significant RAM
- GPU support depends on CUDA installation

## Dependencies

Main dependencies:
- `faster-whisper`: Optimized Whisper inference
- `sounddevice`: Audio capture
- `keyboard`: Hotkey detection and text injection
- `pyperclip`: Clipboard operations
- `tkinter`: GUI components
- `torch`: ML framework (CPU/CUDA)
