✨ Features
⚡ NEW: Sub-500ms Latency - Blazing fast transcription with optimized VAD
🎙️ Universal Voice Input - Works in ANY Windows application
🚀 GPU Accelerated - CUDA-optimized Whisper with CPU fallback
🧠 Smart Formatting - Context-aware punctuation and capitalization via local AI (Ollama/DeepSeek)
🛠️ Advanced Personalization (via python/personalizer.py):
Custom Vocabulary: Improve recognition for specific terms, names, or acronyms. Create personal_dictionary.csv in ~/.voiceflow/. Format: one entry per line (e.g., MyName or SpokenForm,WrittenForm). This helps Whisper recognize and correctly transcribe your specific vocabulary by influencing its initial prompt.
User-Defined Formatting Rules: Apply custom regex-based text transformations after AI formatting. Create user_formatting_rules.csv in ~/.voiceflow/. Format: pattern,replacement,optional_context_regex (e.g., MyCompany Inc.,MyCompany™,, or conf call,conference call,email).
Basic Voice Commands: Use simple voice commands like "new line", "new paragraph", or "scratch that" for quick editing during dictation. These are processed before AI enhancement.
🔒 100% Private - Everything runs locally on your machine
💰 Completely Free - No subscriptions, no API costs
🖥️ Multiple Modes - Console or System Tray operation
🏆 Current Status - v1.2.1
🆕 What's New in v1.2.1
✨ Advanced Personalization Engine:
Introduced python/personalizer.py for managing user customizations.
Added Custom Vocabulary support via ~/.voiceflow/personal_dictionary.csv to improve Whisper's recognition of specific terms.
Implemented User-Defined Formatting Rules via ~/.voiceflow/user_formatting_rules.csv for custom text replacements using regex, applicable globally or by application context.
Basic Voice Command support (e.g., "new line", "new paragraph", "scratch that").

🚀 Phase 2 Roadmap (Updated)
Next Release (v1.3.0)
Full Integration of Personalization: Ensure personalizer.py is fully utilized by all relevant VoiceFlow execution modes (Enhanced, MCP).
Linux/WSL Compatibility: Fix text injection in terminal environments
Model Persistence: Remember user's preferred Whisper model
Custom Hotkeys: User-configurable key combinations (beyond current config file)
Audio Device Selection: GUI or config option to choose specific microphone input
Enhanced Voice Commands: Expand beyond basic commands (e.g., "delete last word", app-specific commands).
Future Enhancements (v1.4.0+)
Multi-Language Support: Auto-detection and switching
Real-time Confidence: Show transcription accuracy
Export History: Save transcriptions to file
UI for Personalization: Interface for managing custom dictionary and formatting rules.
🛠️ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
No transcription appears: Check microphone permissions
Slow performance: Try smaller model (tiny/base)
CUDA errors: App automatically falls back to CPU
Port conflicts: App tries multiple ports automatically
Personalization Not Working:
Ensure personal_dictionary.csv and user_formatting_rules.csv are in ~/.voiceflow/ (Your User Folder -> .voiceflow).
Check CSV formatting. Errors during loading are printed to the console by personalizer.py.
Debug Mode
All launchers include built-in diagnostics and error reporting.
