A local voice transcription system for Windows that converts speech to text using OpenAI Whisper. Works completely offline with no data sent to external servers.

## Why Use VoiceFlow?

- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally - your voice never leaves your computer
- **Always Available**: Works without internet connection or cloud services
- **Practical Speed**: Fast enough for real-time dictation and note-taking
- **System Integration**: Automatically types or pastes transcribed text into any application
- **Developer Friendly**: Built for coding conversations with technical term recognition

## Control Center

![VoiceFlow Control Center](assets/control-center-gui-clean.png)

The Control Center provides a unified interface for system management:
- System launch and configuration
- Visual demo controls for testing
- Real-time status monitoring with progress indicators
- Test suite execution and health checks

Launch commands:

```bash
# Windows
tools\launchers\LAUNCH_CONTROL_CENTER.bat

# Or run directly
python tools/VoiceFlow_Control_Center.py
```

## What It Does

**Voice to Text Conversion**
- Press and hold Ctrl+Shift to record speech
- Automatic transcription using OpenAI Whisper
- Text is automatically typed into any application

**System Integration**
- Visual status indicator shows recording/processing state
- System tray for easy access and configuration
- Works with any Windows application (browsers, editors, documents)

**Technical Features**
- Offline processing - no internet required
- Configurable audio devices and settings
- Smart text formatting for programming and technical terms
- Clipboard or direct typing output modes

## Installation & Usage

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voiceflow.git
cd voiceflow

# Install with pip (recommended)
pip install -e .

# Or install from PyPI (when available)
pip install voiceflow
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Launch with system tray (recommended)
voiceflow-tray

# Or launch in terminal mode
voiceflow

# Setup and configuration wizard
voiceflow-setup
```

### Windows Quick Launch

For Windows users, use the convenient batch launchers:

```batch
# Double-click to launch
tools/launchers/LAUNCH_TRAY.bat        # System tray mode
tools/launchers/LAUNCH_TERMINAL.bat    # Terminal mode
tools/launchers/LAUNCH_CONTROL_CENTER.bat  # Control center GUI
```

## Visual Status System

The system uses color-coded indicators to show current state:

| Color | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| üîµ Blue | Ready | System ready for voice input |
| üü† Orange | Listening | Recording audio (hold `Ctrl+Shift`) |
| üü¢ Green | Processing | Transcribing and processing audio |
| üî¥ Red | Error | Error state or system issue |

## Default Controls

- Voice Activation: `Ctrl + Shift` (press and hold)
- System Tray: Right-click for settings and options
- Visual Overlay: Bottom-center screen display
- Auto Text Injection: Automatic paste after transcription

## Configuration

Configuration options are available through multiple interfaces:

### System Tray Menu
- Toggle code mode for programming
- Switch between typing and paste injection
- Configure hotkey combinations
- Adjust visual indicator settings

### Configuration Files
- **Main Config**: Automatic creation and management
- **Visual Settings**: Themes, positions, and display options
- **Audio Settings**: Sample rates, devices, and processing options

### Environment Variables
```bash
export VOICEFLOW_MODEL="base.en"     # Whisper model
export VOICEFLOW_DEVICE="cuda"       # Processing device
export VOICEFLOW_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"    # Logging level
```

## Architecture

The system uses a modular 4-layer architecture optimized for low-latency audio processing:

### System Architecture Overview

![VoiceFlow Architecture](assets/voiceflow-architecture-diagram.png)

The system is organized into four distinct layers:
- **User Interface Layer**: Control Center, System Tray, Visual Overlays
- **Integration Layer**: Global hotkeys, text injection, system events
- **Core Processing Layer**: Audio capture, ASR engine, performance optimizations
- **Hardware/OS Layer**: Audio devices, drivers, system resources
