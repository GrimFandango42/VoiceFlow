## 🎯 Version Comparison

| Version | Speed | Features | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Simple** | Fast | Core transcription | Daily driver, reliable |
| **Performance** | Fastest | Speed-optimized | Power users, minimal latency |
| **Enhanced** | Medium | Full AI features | Advanced users, formatting |

## 🔧 Performance Options

### Model Selection (Speed vs Accuracy)
- **Tiny**: ~100ms latency, basic accuracy, 1GB VRAM
- **Base**: ~200ms latency, good accuracy, 1GB VRAM  
- **Small**: ~400ms latency, best accuracy, 2GB VRAM

### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum**: CPU-only operation (slower but works)
- **Recommended**: NVIDIA GPU with 2GB+ VRAM
- **Optimal**: NVIDIA GPU with 4GB+ VRAM

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Health Check
```batch
python quick_system_check.py
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```batch
python comprehensive_end_to_end_test.py
```

### Native Functionality Test
```batch
python native/functional_test.py
```

## 🚀 Phase 2 Roadmap

### Next Release (v1.2.0)
- **Linux/WSL Compatibility**: Fix text injection in terminal environments
- **Model Persistence**: Remember user's preferred Whisper model
- **Custom Hotkeys**: User-configurable key combinations
- **Audio Device Selection**: Choose specific microphone input

### Future Enhancements (v1.3.0+)
- **Multi-Language Support**: Auto-detection and switching
- **Voice Commands**: "new paragraph", "comma", etc.
- **Real-time Confidence**: Show transcription accuracy
- **Export History**: Save transcriptions to file

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No transcription appears**: Check microphone permissions
2. **Slow performance**: Try smaller model (tiny/base)
3. **CUDA errors**: App automatically falls back to CPU
4. **Port conflicts**: App tries multiple ports automatically

### Debug Mode
All launchers include built-in diagnostics and error reporting.
