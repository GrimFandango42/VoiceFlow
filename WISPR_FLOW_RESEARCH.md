# Wispr Flow Research - Key Insights for VoiceFlow Implementation

## Core Wispr Flow Functionality

### Global Hotkey Operation
- **Activation**: Press hotkey (customizable, default Option key twice on Mac, need Ctrl+Alt+Space for Windows)
- **Workflow**: Press hotkey → Start speaking → Pause → Instantly pastes formatted text at cursor
- **Universal**: Works in ANY application - emails, word processors, messaging apps, browsers

### Technical Architecture
- **Real-time Processing**: Converts speech to formatted text in seconds
- **AI Auto-editing**: Detects and corrects errors mid-sentence, handles corrections/rephrasing
- **Cross-platform**: Available on Windows and Mac
- **Speed**: Claims 220 wpm vs 45 wpm typing
- **Privacy**: Uses private cloud with encryption (our advantage: 100% local)

### Key Features We Must Match
1. **Invisible Operation**: No visible UI during transcription
2. **Instant Text Injection**: Text appears where cursor is, in any app
3. **Smart Formatting**: AI enhancement with proper punctuation/grammar
4. **Voice Activity Detection**: Automatic start/stop based on speech
5. **Error Correction**: Handles mid-sentence corrections naturally
6. **Whisper Mode**: Works even when speaking quietly

### Windows-Specific Requirements
- **Global Hotkey**: Must work across all applications without stealing focus
- **Text Injection**: Must work in Office, browsers, chat apps, IDEs
- **System Integration**: No admin rights required, starts with Windows
- **Performance**: Sub-second response time for short phrases

### Implementation Priorities for VoiceFlow
1. Fix hotkey to `ctrl+alt+space` (not just `ctrl+alt`)
2. Implement proper global hotkey that actually starts/stops recording
3. Robust text injection using multiple Windows APIs
4. Make completely invisible during operation
5. Auto-recovery and always-running service
6. Context-aware formatting based on active application

### Competitive Advantages VoiceFlow Should Emphasize
- **100% Local**: No cloud dependency, complete privacy
- **Free**: No $12/month subscription
- **Open Source**: Customizable and transparent
- **GPU Accelerated**: Faster than cloud processing
- **Unlimited Usage**: No word limits or throttling

## Next Steps
- Implement Windows-native global hotkey system
- Create robust multi-method text injection
- Build invisible background service
- Add application context detection
- Integrate with existing MCP ecosystem for enhanced capabilities
