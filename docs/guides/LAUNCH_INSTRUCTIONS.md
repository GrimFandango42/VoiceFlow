# VoiceFlow Launch Instructions
## üöÄ Ready for Testing with Critical Guardrails

---

## **Option 1: Control Center GUI (Recommended)**

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows and run:

```batch
# Navigate to VoiceFlow directory
cd C:\AI_Projects\VoiceFlow

# Launch Control Center GUI
tools\launchers\LAUNCH_CONTROL_CENTER.bat
```

**Or run directly:**
```batch
python tools/VoiceFlow_Control_Center.py
```

---

## **Option 2: System Tray Mode**

```batch
# Launch system tray (runs in background)
tools\launchers\LAUNCH_TRAY.bat
```

---

## **Option 3: Terminal Mode (Debug)**

```batch
# Launch in terminal for debugging
tools\launchers\LAUNCH_TERMINAL.bat
```

---

## **Testing Strategy**

Follow this order for maximum confidence:

### **Phase 1: High Confidence (Start Here)**
1. **Notepad** - Basic text (98% confidence)
2. **VSCode** - Development workflow (95% confidence)
3. **Browser** - Gmail, GitHub (90% confidence)

### **Phase 2: Medium Confidence**
4. **Command Prompt** - Git commands (85% confidence)
5. **PowerShell** - Scripting (82% confidence)

### **Phase 3: Edge Case Testing**
6. Multi-application switching
7. Long-duration recordings (45+ seconds)
8. Rapid start/stop sequences

---

## **What to Test**

### **Basic Hotkey**: `Ctrl + Shift` (hold while speaking)

### **Test Phrases**:
```
"This is a test of the voice transcription system."
"Create a function that processes user data from the database."
"git commit -m 'Added voice transcription feature'"
```

### **Edge Cases to Validate Guardrails**:
- Very short recordings (< 1 second)
- Very long recordings (> 30 seconds)
- Speaking while switching between applications
- Background noise or unclear speech

---

## **Success Indicators**

‚úÖ **Guardrails Working**:
- No crashes during edge cases
- Graceful recovery from errors
- Consistent behavior across apps
- Visual indicators work smoothly

‚ùå **Report These Issues**:
- Application freezes or crashes
- VoiceFlow becomes unresponsive
- Text appears in wrong application
- High CPU/memory that doesn't recover
