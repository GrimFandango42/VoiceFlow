## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React Style
- Use ES6+ features
- Functional components with hooks
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic

```javascript
// Good
const TranscriptionDisplay = ({ text, isProcessing }) => {
  const formattedText = useMemo(() => 
    formatTranscription(text), [text]
  );
  
  return (
    <div className={`transcription ${isProcessing ? 'processing' : ''}`}>
      {formattedText}
    </div>
  );
};

// Avoid
const TD = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.t}</div>
}
```

### Rust Style
- Follow Rust conventions
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting
- Meaningful error messages
- Document public APIs

```rust
// Good
pub fn register_hotkey(shortcut: &str) -> Result<(), HotkeyError> {
    // Implementation with proper error handling
}

// Document public functions
/// Registers a global hotkey for the application
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `shortcut` - The key combination (e.g., "Ctrl+Alt+Space")
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` if successful
/// * `Err(HotkeyError)` if registration fails
```

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Type hints where applicable
- Docstrings for functions
- Async/await for I/O operations

```python
# Good
async def process_audio(
    audio_data: np.ndarray, 
    model_size: str = "base"
) -> TranscriptionResult:
    """
    Process audio data through Whisper model.
    
    Args:
        audio_data: NumPy array of audio samples
        model_size: Whisper model size to use
        
    Returns:
        TranscriptionResult with text and metadata
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

```
Add GPU memory optimization for large models

- Implement dynamic batch sizing based on available VRAM
- Add fallback to smaller model when memory is low
- Fix memory leak in model switching

Fixes #123
```
