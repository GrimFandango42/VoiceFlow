## I. Modern AI-First Architecture ü§ñ

**Principle**: Leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities for superior transcription quality.

### Core Tenets:
- **State-of-Art Models**: Use Whisper V3 Turbo, WhisperX for production quality
- **Advanced Features**: Word-level timestamps, speaker diarization, context awareness
- **Intelligent Processing**: Smart chunking, VAD preprocessing, forced alignment
- **Performance Optimization**: Batched inference, GPU acceleration, memory efficiency

### 2024 AI Capabilities to Leverage:
- ‚úÖ WhisperX for 70x realtime performance + word-level timestamps
- ‚úÖ Speaker diarization for multi-speaker contexts
- ‚úÖ Context-aware processing with sliding windows
- ‚úÖ VAD preprocessing to reduce hallucinations
- ‚úÖ Forced phoneme alignment for accuracy

## II. Performance Through Persistence üöÄ

**Principle**: Keep expensive resources loaded and optimize for repeated use.

### Implementation Guidelines:
- **Model Persistence**: Load Whisper models once, keep them in memory
- **Thread Safety**: Use simple locks around model access, not complex pooling
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track memory and performance, but don't over-optimize
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle errors without destroying working state

### Production Lessons:
- Modern faster-whisper implementations are designed for persistence
- Model reloading is expensive (2-10 seconds) and should be rare
- Simple error handling (reload after 5+ consecutive failures) works better than complex recovery
- Memory leaks come from poor cleanup, not model persistence

---

## III. Practical-First Development üîß

**Principle**: Build working solutions first, then optimize. Direct fixes beat complex architectures.

### Implementation Approach:
- **Direct Problem Solving**: Fix the specific issue users experience, not theoretical edge cases
- **Working Code First**: Get something working, then improve incrementally
- **Real-World Testing**: Test with actual usage patterns, not synthetic scenarios
- **User Experience Focus**: Optimize for what users actually need and notice

### Proven Patterns:
- Enhanced state management beats complex state machines
- Auto-recovery mechanisms beat elaborate error handling systems
- Quality monitoring beats performance profiling
- Diagnostic tools beat complex testing frameworks

---

## IV. Production-Ready Defaults üíº

**Principle**: Design for long-running, real-world usage from day one.

### Operational Requirements:
- **24/7 Operation**: Systems must handle continuous background operation
- **Variable Usage**: Support patterns from 0.5s commands to 5-minute speeches
- **Resource Efficiency**: Maintain stable memory usage over hours/days
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures gracefully without user intervention

### Testing Standards:
- Test for extended periods (30+ minutes minimum)
- Validate memory stability over time
- Stress test with rapid successive operations
- Verify recovery from various failure modes

## V. Evidence-Based Optimization üìä

**Principle**: Make changes based on measurement and research, not assumptions.

### Measurement Requirements:
- **Benchmark Before Changes**: Establish baseline performance metrics
