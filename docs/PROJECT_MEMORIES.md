# VoiceFlow Project Memories

## Critical Workflow Requirements

### ðŸš¨ ALWAYS LAUNCH GUI CONTROL CENTER AFTER CHANGES
**This is the #1 most important workflow rule - DO NOT FORGET!**

- After making ANY changes to the VoiceFlow codebase
- After fixing issues, implementing features, or updating configurations
- User explicitly stated: "Remember that every time we're making changes, I shut the control center so that you can re-launch it for me once you're done making all changes"
- User gets frustrated when this is forgotten: "You again feel to launch the GUI Control Center? How do you keep forgetting that?"

**Control Center Locations:**
- Primary: `tools/VoiceFlow_Control_Center.py`
- Testing: `scripts/testing/launch_control_center.py` (has Unicode issues)
- Simple: `scripts/testing/simple_control_center.py` (backup option)

### Health Check Requirements
- Health checks and critical tests MUST pass before handoff
- User emphasized: "I really need to have you make sure that the health checks as well as the critical tests work before you hand off to me"
- Run: `python scripts/dev/quick_smoke_test.py`

### Testing Standards
- Test thoroughly before handing off to user
- User feedback: "Come on, please test thoroughly before handing off to me. This is frustrating."
- Verify all components work together, not just individual pieces

## Current Project Status

### Phase 2 Optimizations âœ… COMPLETED
- GPU acceleration with CUDA fallback
- Dual-model strategy (tiny.en â†’ small.en)
- Advanced VAD for smart chunking
- Batched processing (12.5x speedup potential)
- Fixed visual indicators system
- All health checks passing

### Technical Architecture
- Main ASR: `src/voiceflow/core/advanced_performance_asr.py`
- Config: `src/voiceflow/core/config.py`
- Visual indicators: `src/voiceflow/ui/visual_indicators.py`
- Ultra performance CLI: `src/voiceflow/ui/cli_ultra_performance.py`

### User Testing Feedback History
1. "First sentence was slow" â†’ Fixed with Phase 2 optimizations
2. "Visual indicators not working" â†’ Fixed import and config issues
3. "Buffer issues" â†’ No longer present, system stable
4. "Health checks must work" â†’ All smoke tests now pass (7/7)

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes
2. Run health checks: `python scripts/dev/quick_smoke_test.py`
3. Test integration thoroughly
4. **ðŸš¨ LAUNCH GUI CONTROL CENTER** (most important step!)
5. Hand off to user for testing

## Key Lessons Learned
- Always prioritize the GUI Control Center launch
- Health checks are critical before handoff
- Visual system requires careful import handling
- CUDA fallback is essential for reliability
- User values thorough testing over speed
