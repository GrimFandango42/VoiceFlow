## Critical Security Issues

### üî¥ CRITICAL-1: Diagnostic Data Leakage in Error Recovery
**File:** `src/voiceflow/stability/error_recovery.py`
**Lines:** 92-96, 284-287

**Issue:** The error recovery system stores potentially sensitive data in diagnostic contexts without sanitization.

**Evidence:**
```python
# In create_recovery_context()
context.diagnostic_data = diagnostic_data.copy()  # Direct copy without sanitization

# Testing revealed:
malicious_context = {
    'user_data': {'password': 'secret123'},
    'system_command': 'rm -rf /',
}
# This data gets stored in recovery context
```

**Impact:** Sensitive user data, system commands, or authentication tokens could be logged or persist in memory across transcription sessions.

**Recommendation:** Implement data sanitization in error recovery:
```python
def _sanitize_diagnostic_data(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Remove sensitive data from diagnostic context"""
    sensitive_keys = ['password', 'token', 'key', 'secret', 'auth', 'credential']
    sanitized = {}
    for k, v in data.items():
        if any(sensitive in k.lower() for sensitive in sensitive_keys):
            sanitized[k] = "[REDACTED]"
        elif isinstance(v, str) and len(v) > 1000:
            sanitized[k] = v[:100] + "[TRUNCATED]"
        else:
            sanitized[k] = v
    return sanitized
```

### üî¥ CRITICAL-2: Script Injection in Hallucination Cleaning
**File:** `src/voiceflow/stability/hallucination_detector.py`
**Lines:** 162-198

**Issue:** The hallucination cleaning function does not sanitize HTML/JavaScript content.

**Evidence:**
```python
# Input: 'okay okay okay <script>alert(1)</script>'
# Output: 'okay okay okay <script>alert(1)</script>' (unchanged)
```

**Impact:** Malicious script content could survive hallucination detection and be injected into downstream systems.

**Recommendation:** Add script sanitization to `clean_transcription()`:
```python
def clean_transcription(self, text: str) -> str:
    # ... existing code ...

    # Sanitize potentially dangerous content
    text = self._sanitize_dangerous_content(text)

    return text

def _sanitize_dangerous_content(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Remove potentially dangerous content"""
    import re
    # Remove script tags
    text = re.sub(r'<script[^>]*>.*?</script>', '', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL)
    # Remove other dangerous HTML
    text = re.sub(r'<[^>]*>', '', text)
    # Remove potential command injection
    text = re.sub(r'[;&|`$]', '', text)
    return text
```

## High Security Issues

### üü† HIGH-1: Audio Buffer Memory Exposure
**File:** `src/voiceflow/core/asr_buffer_safe.py`
**Lines:** 421-430, 505-508

**Issue:** Audio buffers are not securely zeroed after use, potentially leaving sensitive audio data in memory.

**Evidence:**
```python
def transcribe(self, audio: np.ndarray) -> str:
    # ... processing ...
    finally:
        if 'recording_state' in locals():
            del recording_state  # Simple deletion, no secure zeroing
```

**Impact:** Sensitive audio content could persist in memory and be accessible to other processes or during memory dumps.

**Recommendation:** Implement secure memory clearing:
```python
def _secure_clear_audio_buffer(self, audio: np.ndarray):
    """Securely clear audio buffer from memory"""
    if audio is not None and audio.size > 0:
        audio.fill(0.0)  # Zero out the memory
        del audio

# In transcribe() finally block:
if 'recording_state' in locals():
    if 'audio' in recording_state:
        self._secure_clear_audio_buffer(recording_state['audio'])
```

### üü† HIGH-2: Model Reload Race Condition
**File:** `src/voiceflow/core/asr_buffer_safe.py`
**Lines:** 221-333

**Issue:** The aggressive model reloading could create race conditions where old model data is accessible during reload.

**Evidence:**
```python
def _reload_model_fresh(self):
    old_model = self._model
    self._model = None  # Gap where model is None
    # ... model creation ...
    # Potential for old_model memory to be accessible
```

**Impact:** Transcription data from previous sessions could leak between model reloads.

**Recommendation:** Atomic model swapping with secure cleanup:
```python
def _reload_model_fresh(self):
    with self._model_lock:
        temp_model = self._create_fresh_model()
        if temp_model is not None:
            old_model = self._model
            self._model = temp_model  # Atomic swap
            if old_model is not None:
                self._secure_model_cleanup(old_model)
```

### üü† HIGH-3: Logging Information Disclosure
**File:** `src/voiceflow/stability/logging_config.py`
**Lines:** 136-154

**Issue:** Error logging includes full context dictionaries that may contain sensitive information.

**Evidence:**
```python
def log_error_with_context(error, context, component):
    error_logger.error(f"Context: {context}")  # Full context logged
```

**Impact:** Sensitive transcription content, user data, or system information could be logged in plaintext.

**Recommendation:** Implement context sanitization for logging:
```python
def log_error_with_context(error, context, component):
    sanitized_context = _sanitize_log_context(context)
    error_logger.error(f"Context: {sanitized_context}")

def _sanitize_log_context(context: dict) -> dict:
    """Sanitize context for safe logging"""
    safe_context = {}
    for k, v in context.items():
        if k.lower() in ['transcription_text', 'audio_data']:
            safe_context[k] = f"[REDACTED_{len(str(v))}_chars]"
        elif isinstance(v, str) and len(v) > 100:
            safe_context[k] = v[:50] + "[TRUNCATED]"
        else:
            safe_context[k] = v
    return safe_context
```

## Medium Security Issues

### üü° MEDIUM-1: Insufficient Input Validation
**File:** `src/voiceflow/core/optimized_audio_validation.py`
**Lines:** 217-225

**Issue:** Statistical sampling in audio validation could miss malicious patterns in unsampled portions.

**Recommendation:** Increase minimum sample size for security-critical operations and add full validation fallback for suspicious patterns.

### üü° MEDIUM-2: Temporary File Security
**File:** Multiple locations

**Issue:** Log files and temporary audio buffers may not have appropriate file permissions.

**Recommendation:** Set restrictive permissions (600) on all log files and temporary data.

### üü° MEDIUM-3: Memory Pool Reuse
**File:** `src/voiceflow/core/asr_buffer_safe.py`
**Lines:** 509-531

**Issue:** Buffer pool reuse could lead to data leakage between transcription sessions.

**Recommendation:** Implement secure buffer clearing before pool reuse.

### üü° MEDIUM-4: Error Message Information Disclosure
**File:** Various error handling locations

**Issue:** Error messages may expose internal system paths and configuration details.

**Recommendation:** Implement generic error messages for user-facing errors while maintaining detailed internal logging.

---

## Low Security Issues

### üü¢ LOW-1: Predictable Recording IDs
**File:** `src/voiceflow/core/asr_buffer_safe.py`
**Line:** 592

**Issue:** Recording IDs use predictable timestamps.

**Recommendation:** Use cryptographically secure random IDs.

### üü¢ LOW-2: Verbose Debug Logging
**Issue:** Debug logs may contain sensitive operational details.

**Recommendation:** Review and sanitize debug log content.

### üü¢ LOW-3: Global State Management
**Issue:** Global validator instances could create cross-session data persistence.

**Recommendation:** Implement session-scoped validators.

### üü¢ LOW-4-6: Additional minor issues with configuration handling, error propagation, and resource cleanup.
