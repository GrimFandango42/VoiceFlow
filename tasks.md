# Tasks: VoiceFlow System Enhancement

**Feature**: Clean Tray Tests & Installer Enhancements
**Input**: Existing VoiceFlow codebase analysis
**Prerequisites**: Python environment, Windows development setup

## Execution Flow
```
1. System Assessment
   → Analyze existing tray implementation
   → Review test coverage and quality
   → Identify installer improvements needed
2. Implementation Plan
   → Tech stack: Python 3.9+, PyQt/Tkinter, pytest
   → Libraries: pystray, faster-whisper, sounddevice
   → Structure: src/voiceflow/, tests/, tools/
3. Task Categories
   → Setup: Environment and dependencies
   → Tests: Unit, integration, stability tests
   → Core: Tray improvements, Control Center
   → Installation: Setup script enhancements
   → Polish: Documentation, optimization

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T004) must complete before all other phases
- Tests (T005-T011) before core implementation (T012-T025)
- Core tray (T012-T018) before Control Center (T019-T025)
- All implementation before integration testing (T037-T042)
- Everything before polish phase (T043-T050)

## Parallel Execution Examples
```bash
# Launch test cleanup tasks together (T005-T007):
Task: "Audit and organize test suite in tests/unit/"
Task: "Consolidate integration tests in tests/integration/"
Task: "Clean up stability tests in tests/stability/"

# Launch tray test creation together (T009-T011):
Task: "Add tray component unit tests in tests/unit/test_tray_components.py"
Task: "Add Control Center GUI tests in tests/unit/test_control_center.py"
Task: "Add installer validation tests in tests/unit/test_installer.py"

# Launch documentation tasks together (T043-T046):
Task: "Update README.md with new features"
Task: "Create CHANGELOG.md with version history"
Task: "Document troubleshooting guide in docs/troubleshooting.md"
Task: "Add API documentation in docs/api.md"
```

## Task Validation Checklist
- [x] All tray components have corresponding tests
- [x] Control Center features have GUI tests
- [x] Installer has validation tests
- [x] Tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks work on different files
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No parallel tasks modify same file

## Notes
- Priority focus: Tray stability, test organization, installer reliability
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations
- Preserve existing hotkey functionality (Ctrl+Shift+Space)
- Keep Control Center as primary user interface
- Test on Windows 10 and Windows 11
- Consider portable version for USB deployment
- Maintain <200ms response time for tray interactions
- Keep memory usage under 200MB during idle
## Phase 0: Stability Safeguards (2025-09-28)
- [x] T000 Implement NullWhisperModel fallback to avoid NoneType context errors (src/voiceflow/core/asr_buffer_safe.py)
- [x] T000 Add preserve-then-replace model reload to BufferSafeWhisperASR (src/voiceflow/core/asr_buffer_safe.py)
- [x] T000 Add unit tests covering model reload fallback behaviour (tests/unit/test_core/test_asr_model_management.py)
