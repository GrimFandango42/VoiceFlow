# VoiceFlow Progress Report - Session 1

## üéâ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality Working
- **Hotkey Detection**: Ctrl+Shift working with admin privileges
- **Audio Capture**: Successfully recording audio input
- **Transcription**: Basic speech-to-text functional
- **Text Injection**: Clipboard paste working

### ‚úÖ Technical Issues Resolved
- **Unicode Crashes**: Fixed emoji display issues in Windows terminal
- **CUDA Compatibility**: Switched to CPU mode (int8) for stability
- **Module Dependencies**: All imports and package structure working
- **Admin Privileges**: Identified and resolved global hotkey permissions

### ‚úÖ Configuration Optimized
- **Model**: Upgraded from small.en to base.en for better accuracy
- **Audio Buffer**: Reduced to 512 frames for faster response
- **Batch Size**: Reduced to 4 for lower latency
- **Device**: CPU with int8 compute type (stable)

## üö´ IDENTIFIED LIMITATIONS

### ‚ùå Conversation Length Issues
- **Buffer Overflow**: Fails after ~2 sentences 
- **Memory Management**: Not handling longer conversations (2-3 minutes)
- **Context Loss**: No streaming or chunked processing
- **Performance Degradation**: Speed decreases over time

### ‚ùå Performance Gaps vs WhisperSync
- **Latency**: Still slower than commercial alternatives
- **Accuracy**: Degrades with longer input
- **Resource Usage**: Higher CPU/memory consumption

## üéØ NEXT PHASE OBJECTIVES

### Phase 1: Buffer & Memory Optimization
- Implement streaming transcription
- Fix buffer overflow issues
- Optimize memory usage patterns
- Add context preservation

### Phase 2: Long Conversation Support
- 2-3 minute continuous transcription
- Pause handling and resumption
- Audio buffer management
- Real-time performance maintenance

### Phase 3: Performance Parity
- Match WhisperSync speed/accuracy
- Reduce resource consumption
- Improve response latency
- Optimize model efficiency

## üìä CURRENT STATUS
- **State**: Functional MVP with limitations
- **Priority**: Long conversation support
- **Timeline**: Phase 1 completion target
- **Risk**: Buffer overflow blocking production use
