# VoiceFlow Restart Success Guide

## ✅ VoiceFlow Successfully Restarted!

I've killed the old Python processes and started a fresh VoiceFlow instance. 

## Critical Changes Now Active:

### 1. NEW HOTKEY: `Ctrl + Alt + F12`
- **OLD (problematic)**: `Ctrl + Shift` (caused accidental triggers while typing)
- **NEW (fixed)**: `Ctrl + Alt + F12` (won't trigger during normal typing)

### 2. Buffer Isolation Fixes Applied
- Pre-buffer cleared immediately after use
- Main buffer always cleared at recording start
- No more accumulation between recordings

### 3. Unicode Issues Resolved
- No more Windows encoding crashes
- All emoji characters replaced with ASCII

## Testing Protocol

### Step 1: Verify New Hotkey
**Test that the new hotkey works:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + F12` to START recording
2. Say: "Testing new hotkey configuration"
3. Press `Ctrl + Alt + F12` to STOP recording
4. **Expected**: Clean transcription, no duplicates

### Step 2: Buffer Isolation Test
**Test that buffer isolation is working:**

**Recording 1** (use `Ctrl + Alt + F12`):
> "This is the first recording to test buffer isolation."

**Recording 2** (use `Ctrl + Alt + F12`):
> "This is the second recording which should not contain the first."

**Recording 3** (use `Ctrl + Alt + F12`):
> "Third and final recording to verify no accumulation occurs."

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Each recording contains ONLY its own content
- ✅ NO duplication or repetition
- ✅ NO "flashes" of previous transcriptions
- ✅ NO accidental triggers while typing responses

### Step 3: Typing Safety Test
**Test that typing won't trigger recordings:**
1. Start typing normally with Ctrl+Shift combinations (for capitals)
2. Type transcription responses in chat
3. **Expected**: No accidental recording starts

## What Should Be Different Now:

### Before (Problematic Behavior):
- ❌ "First recording...first recording..." (duplicates)
- ❌ Mid-sentence cutoffs from accidental triggers
- ❌ "Flash of buffer onto display" while typing
- ❌ Ctrl+Shift triggering recordings during typing

### After (Fixed Behavior):
- ✅ Clean, single transcriptions
- ✅ Only trigger with `Ctrl+Alt+F12`
- ✅ Safe typing without accidental recordings
- ✅ Complete buffer isolation

## If Issues Persist:

If you still see buffer repeats after using `Ctrl+Alt+F12`, then we need to investigate deeper architectural issues. But the hotkey change should eliminate the "accidental trigger while typing" problem you described.

## Ready for Testing!

**Use the new hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + F12` and test the buffer isolation.**
