## üìã Test Cases by Confidence Level

### üü¢ **HIGH CONFIDENCE** (95%+ expected success)

#### **Test Case 1: VSCode Integration**
**Environment**: VSCode with Python/JavaScript files
**Confidence**: 95% - Text editors are optimal for voice transcription

**Test Steps**:
1. Open VSCode with a Python file
2. Place cursor in a function or comment area
3. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and say: "Define a function called process data that takes a list of numbers and returns the average"
4. Release keys and verify text appears correctly formatted
5. **Expected**: Should type properly formatted code comment or function stub

**Stress Test**:
- Try very long dictation (30+ seconds)
- Use technical terms: "asyncio", "numpy", "pandas", "matplotlib"
- Test with background noise or unclear speech

**Guardrail Validation**:
- Intentionally speak unclear/mumbled words to test fallback behavior
- Test with cursor in different positions (strings, comments, code)

#### **Test Case 2: Notepad Basic Text**
**Environment**: Windows Notepad
**Confidence**: 98% - Simple text input, minimal complexity

**Test Steps**:
1. Open Notepad
2. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and say: "This is a test of the voice transcription system with punctuation, numbers like 123, and special characters."
3. Verify punctuation and formatting
4. **Expected**: Clean, properly punctuated text

**Stress Test**:
- Test numbers, dates, email addresses
- Try rapid speech, slow speech, different volumes
- Test with multiple paragraphs

#### **Test Case 3: Browser Text Fields**
**Environment**: Web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
**Confidence**: 90% - Standard web forms work well

**Test Steps**:
1. Open browser to Gmail compose, Google Docs, or any text area
2. Click in text field
3. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and dictate an email or document paragraph
4. **Expected**: Text appears in browser field correctly

**Stress Test**:
- Test in different websites (Gmail, GitHub, Stack Overflow)
- Try rich text editors vs plain text areas
- Test with browser extensions active

### üü° **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE** (80-90% expected success)

#### **Test Case 4: Command Prompt/PowerShell**
**Environment**: cmd.exe or PowerShell
**Confidence**: 85% - Terminal environments can be tricky

**Test Steps**:
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and say: "git commit -m 'Added new feature for user authentication'"
3. **Expected**: Command appears on command line

**Known Issues to Test**:
- Some terminals may not support clipboard injection
- Test both typing and paste injection modes
- Verify special characters (quotes, hyphens) work correctly

**Fallback Test**:
- If direct injection fails, verify clipboard method works
- Test copying result to clipboard manually

---

#### **Test Case 5: Cloud Code IDE**
**Environment**: Google Cloud Code in browser or desktop
**Confidence**: 82% - Cloud IDEs have varying clipboard support

**Test Steps**:
1. Open Cloud Code with a project
2. Navigate to a code file
3. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and dictate code comments or documentation
4. **Expected**: Text appears in Cloud Code editor

**Potential Issues**:
- Cloud environments may have security restrictions
- Network latency might affect responsiveness
- Test with different project types (Python, JavaScript, Go)

---

### üî¥ **LOWER CONFIDENCE** (60-80% expected success)

#### **Test Case 6: Specialized Applications**
**Environment**: Excel, Word, specialized IDEs
**Confidence**: 70% - Complex applications may have integration challenges

**Test Steps**:
1. Open Microsoft Word or Excel
2. Test voice input in different contexts:
   - Word: Document text, comments, headers
   - Excel: Cell values, formulas, notes
3. **Expected**: Basic text input works, formatting may vary

**Known Limitations**:
- Rich text formatting may not be preserved
- Some specialized input fields may not work
- Application-specific shortcuts might interfere

## üß™ Automated Pre-Testing Validation

Before manual testing, I'll run these automated checks:

### Audio System Validation
```python
# Test that will be run automatically
def test_audio_guardrails():
    # Test empty audio handling
    # Test NaN/infinite value sanitization
    # Test extreme amplitude clipping
    # Test stereo-to-mono conversion
```

### Configuration Validation
```python
def test_config_guardrails():
    # Test invalid sample rate correction
    # Test missing hotkey handling
    # Test model validation
```

### Thread Safety Validation
```python
def test_visual_thread_safety():
    # Test visual updates from worker threads
    # Test error recovery in GUI operations
    # Test queue processing
```

## üéØ Specific Edge Case Testing

### **Critical Failure Scenarios to Test**
These scenarios previously caused the 10/40 edge case failures:

#### **Scenario 1: Audio System Stress**
1. Start recording, then quickly start/stop multiple times
2. Hold button while moving between applications rapidly
3. Test with system under high CPU load
4. **Expected**: No crashes, graceful handling of rapid state changes

#### **Scenario 2: Configuration Edge Cases**
1. Test with very short recordings (< 1 second)
2. Test with very long recordings (> 30 seconds)
3. Test with no internet connection (offline mode)
4. **Expected**: System handles all durations gracefully

#### **Scenario 3: Multi-Application Switching**
1. Start recording in VSCode
2. Alt+Tab to different application while holding Ctrl+Shift
3. Release in different application
4. **Expected**: Text appears in final focused application

#### **Scenario 4: Resource Exhaustion**
1. Open many applications (10+ windows)
2. Test voice input with high memory usage
3. Test during file operations or system updates
4. **Expected**: System remains responsive, degrades gracefully
