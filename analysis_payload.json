  "prompt": "You are an expert performance optimization engineer. Analyze the following VoiceFlow audio transcription system for additional performance improvements.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\n- Already achieved 4.9x speed improvement (1.9x to 9.3x realtime)\n- Using tiny.en Whisper model for speed\n- Beam size = 1, temperature = 0.0\n- Disabled VAD, optimized logging\n- CPU-based inference with int8 compute\n- Model reload reduced from 20 to 100 transcriptions\n- Pre-buffer system with 1.5s duration\n- Bounded ring buffers to prevent memory growth\n\nGOAL: Find 20-50% additional speed improvements\n\nKEY BOTTLENECKS TO ANALYZE:\n1. Audio preprocessing pipeline (validation, conversion, buffering)\n2. Memory management and garbage collection\n3. Threading and concurrency patterns\n4. Buffer management performance\n5. NumPy operations optimization\n6. Model inference optimization beyond current settings\n7. Audio I/O optimization\n\nCONFIGURATION ANALYSIS:\n- sample_rate: 16000 (standard)\n- blocksize: 512 frames (~32ms latency)\n- channels: 1 (mono)\n- model: tiny.en (fastest)\n- compute_type: int8 (CPU optimized)\n- beam_size: 1 (greedy decoding)\n- temperature: 0.0 (deterministic)\n- VAD disabled (prevents state pollution)\n\nKEY PERFORMANCE AREAS:\n\n1. AUDIO VALIDATION OVERHEAD:\n- Multiple validation layers in audio_validation_guard()\n- NaN/Inf checking on every callback\n- Dtype conversions and amplitude checks\n- Memory copying for sanitization\n\n2. BUFFER MANAGEMENT:\n- Ring buffer operations with locking\n- Continuous pre-buffer recording\n- Memory allocation patterns\n- Array concatenation overhead\n\n3.
