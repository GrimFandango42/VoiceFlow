# Tasks: Clean Tray Tests & Installer Enhancements

**Input**: Design documents from `C:\AI_Projects\VoiceFlow\specs\clean-tray-tests-installer-enh\`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: Python 3.9+, pystray, faster-whisper, sounddevice, tkinter, pytest
2. Load design documents: ✓
   → data-model.md: 5 entities (TrayState, TestConfiguration, InstallerConfiguration, SystemPerformance, ControlCenterState)
   → contracts/: 3 interface files (tray_interface.py, test_interface.py, installer_interface.py)
   → quickstart.md: 5 test scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: environment, dependencies, test infrastructure
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD)
   → Core: models, enhanced components, interfaces
   → Integration: system integration, performance monitoring
   → Polish: documentation, optimization, validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Tasks numbered T001-T050 with clear dependencies
```

## Task Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts (3 interfaces) have corresponding contract tests
- [x] All entities (5 models) have unit tests and implementation tasks
- [x] All quickstart scenarios (5 scenarios) have integration tests
- [x] Tests come before implementation (TDD approach)
- [x] Parallel tasks work on different files
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No parallel tasks modify same file

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run concurrently
- All tests must fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Constitutional compliance validation required throughout
- Performance thresholds must be maintained (<200ms response, <200MB memory)
- Windows-specific optimizations prioritized over cross-platform compatibility
- Commit after completing each task for incremental progress tracking

## Constitutional Compliance Validation
Each task must verify compliance with VoiceFlow Constitution v1.0.0:
1. **Privacy-First**: No external data transmission
2. **Real-Time Performance**: <200ms response times
3. **Windows-First**: Platform-specific optimizations
4. **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test coverage
5. **User-Centric**: Control Center as primary interface
