# Feature Specification: Fix NoneType Context Manager Error in VoiceFlow Transcription

**Feature Branch**: `001-fix-nonetype-context`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix NoneType context manager error in VoiceFlow transcription system - comprehensive analysis shows model becomes None after 2 transcriptions due to faulty reload logic"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: Critical transcription system error identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: NoneType error, context manager protocol, model reload failure, transcription threshold
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined through comprehensive technical analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Multiple transcription scenarios defined with clear failure patterns
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Model state, transcription sessions, error recovery identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No ambiguous requirements or implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a VoiceFlow user, I need to be able to perform multiple consecutive voice transcriptions throughout my session without encountering system errors that prevent further transcriptions, so that I can maintain productive voice-to-text workflow without interruption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** VoiceFlow is running and ready, **When** I perform my first voice transcription, **Then** the transcription completes successfully and the system remains ready for the next transcription
2. **Given** I have successfully completed one transcription, **When** I perform a second voice transcription, **Then** the second transcription completes successfully and the system remains ready
3. **Given** I have successfully completed two transcriptions, **When** I perform a third voice transcription, **Then** the third transcription completes successfully without any NoneType errors
4. **Given** I am in an extended usage session, **When** I perform 10+ consecutive transcriptions over several minutes, **Then** all transcriptions complete successfully without system degradation
5. **Given** the system encounters an internal error during transcription, **When** the error is resolved, **Then** subsequent transcriptions work normally without requiring application restart

### Edge Cases
- What happens when transcription model memory becomes fragmented after extended use?
- How does system handle rapid consecutive transcription requests?
- What occurs when system resources become constrained during model operations?
- How does the system recover from temporary model access failures?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST complete transcriptions reliably regardless of session duration or number of previous transcriptions
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain transcription capability after encountering and recovering from internal errors
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide consistent transcription performance across first, second, third, and subsequent transcription attempts
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent NoneType context manager errors from occurring during normal transcription operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically recover from model state corruption without requiring user intervention
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain model availability throughout the entire user session
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle model reload operations without interrupting transcription capability
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messaging when transcription temporarily fails
- **FR-009**: System MUST complete error recovery within 5 seconds of detecting model state issues
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain session state across model maintenance operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Transcription Session**: Represents user's active voice-to-text session with state tracking across multiple transcription attempts
- **Model State**: Represents the current status and availability of the speech recognition model, including loaded/unloaded states
- **Error Recovery Context**: Represents system's ability to diagnose, recover from, and prevent recurrence of transcription failures
