# Tasks: Comprehensive VoiceFlow Stability & Reliability

**Input**: Design documents from `C:\AI_Projects\VoiceFlow\specs\002-comprehensive-voiceflow-stability\`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Tech stack: Python 3.13+, faster-whisper, sounddevice, pytest
   → Structure: Single project with src/voiceflow/ and tests/
2. Load optional design documents: ✓
   → data-model.md: 5 core entities (Audio Session, Transcription Request, System State, Error Recovery Context, Performance Metrics)
   → contracts/: stability_api.py with 6 interfaces and validation contracts
   → research.md: Atomic reference patterns, state-first validation, multi-layer detection
   → quickstart.md: Comprehensive test scenarios with validation checklist
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: stability module structure, dependencies, tooling
   → Tests: stability contracts, integration scenarios, stress testing
   → Core: stability entities, error recovery, performance monitoring
   → Integration: existing component enhancement, state management
   → Polish: comprehensive testing, performance validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Stability modules are new files (parallel capable)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T048)
6. Generate dependency graph and parallel execution examples
7. Validate task completeness: All contracts tested, entities implemented, integration scenarios covered
8. Return: SUCCESS (Core stability achieved through practical fixes and AI enhancements)
```

## Task Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All contract interfaces have corresponding tests (T006-T012)
- [x] All data model entities have implementation tasks (T022-T026)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T006-T021 before T022-T048)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path and clear deliverable
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Integration tests cover all key user scenarios from quickstart.md
- [x] All stability requirements from spec.md have corresponding tasks
- [x] Constitutional compliance maintained (offline operation, performance limits)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify all tests fail before implementing any functionality
- Each task should be completable by an LLM with the task description alone
- Commit after each task completion
- Monitor memory usage and performance throughout implementation
- Maintain existing VoiceFlow functionality while adding stability improvements
