# Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

## Long-Running Python Service Patterns

**Decision**: Implement subprocess-based resource isolation with lazy loading
**Rationale**: Research shows that the only reliable way to ensure complete memory cleanup in Python is subprocess isolation. For long-running services, this prevents gradual memory accumulation.
**Alternatives considered**:
- In-process cleanup with gc.collect() - insufficient for ML models
- Threading-based isolation - shared memory space limitations
- Container-based isolation - too heavyweight for desktop service

## Model Lifecycle Management

**Decision**: Lazy loading with TTL-based unloading and health monitoring
**Rationale**: WhisperLive and production services use deferred initialization with time-to-live patterns to balance performance and resource usage.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Always-loaded models - memory pressure over time
- Per-request loading - unacceptable latency for user experience
- Pool-based loading - complexity without clear benefits for single-user service

## Session State Management

**Decision**: Explicit session boundaries with cleanup hooks and state validation
**Rationale**: Long-running services require clear separation between operations to prevent state pollution and ensure consistent behavior regardless of idle time.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Persistent state - accumulates errors over time
- Stateless operation - loses performance optimizations
- Automatic cleanup - timing difficulties and unpredictable behavior

## Error Recovery Strategy

**Decision**: Circuit breaker pattern with graduated recovery and health monitoring
**Rationale**: Production services use circuit breakers to detect failure patterns and implement automatic recovery without user intervention.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Immediate restart on any error - too aggressive, loses context
- Manual intervention required - violates user experience requirements
- Retry with backoff - insufficient for systematic failures

## Idle Management Architecture

**Decision**: Activity-based timeouts with background health monitoring
**Rationale**: Research shows services that run for days need activity detection to trigger appropriate resource management without impacting active usage.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed-interval cleanup - interferes with user activity
- No idle management - resource accumulation over time
- System-level idle detection - requires elevated permissions

## Memory Management Strategy

**Decision**: Explicit cleanup with monitoring and subprocess recycling for heavy operations
**Rationale**: Python garbage collection is insufficient for ML models and audio buffers. Explicit management with monitoring prevents gradual degradation.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Rely on Python GC - insufficient for native libraries
- Memory pooling - complexity without clear benefits
- Process-per-request - too slow for interactive use

## Configuration Management

**Decision**: Adaptive configuration with runtime optimization based on usage patterns
**Rationale**: Long-running services need to adapt to changing conditions and usage patterns rather than static configuration.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Static configuration - cannot adapt to varying conditions
- User-managed tuning - too complex for end users
- Machine learning optimization - overkill for single-user service

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Extended duration testing with simulated real-world usage patterns
**Rationale**: Short-term tests cannot detect issues that emerge over hours of operation. Need realistic usage simulation.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Unit tests only - insufficient for integration issues
- Manual testing - not reproducible or comprehensive
- Synthetic load testing - doesn't match real usage patterns

## Logging and Monitoring

**Decision**: Structured logging with health metrics and performance tracking
**Rationale**: Long-running services require observability to detect degradation before failure and provide actionable diagnostics.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic logging only - insufficient for troubleshooting
- Metrics without context - difficult to correlate issues
- External monitoring - violates offline-only requirement

## Implementation Priority

**Decision**: Fix immediate logger bug first, then implement core stability infrastructure
**Rationale**: System currently fails after 30 minutes with logger undefined error. Must address blocking issue before implementing comprehensive solution.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Comprehensive rewrite first - would take too long without fixing current issue
- Patch-only approach - wouldn't address long-term stability requirements
- Parallel implementation - risk of introducing additional bugs

## Technology Decisions Summary

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Process Management | subprocess with IPC | Complete isolation for ML operations |
| State Management | Explicit session boundaries | Clear lifecycle for long-running operation |
| Resource Loading | Lazy + TTL | Balance performance and memory usage |
| Error Recovery | Circuit breaker + health monitoring | Automatic recovery without user intervention |
| Configuration | Adaptive runtime optimization | Adjust to real usage patterns |
| Testing | Extended duration simulation | Detect issues that emerge over time |
| Monitoring | Structured logging + metrics | Observability for long-running operation |

## Implementation Sequence

1. **Immediate**: Fix logger undefined error (blocking current failure)
2. **Phase 1**: Session lifecycle management (prevent state pollution)
3. **Phase 2**: Resource management (adaptive loading/unloading)
4. **Phase 3**: Health monitoring (detect and recover from degradation)
5. **Phase 4**: Extended testing (validate 24+ hour operation)
