## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I need a voice transcription system that operates reliably for extended periods (hours) without crashes, incorrect outputs, or system hangs, allowing me to conduct various types of conversations - long speeches, short commands, and intermittent discussions - with consistent accuracy and responsiveness.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system is idle, **When** I press and quickly release the hotkey without speaking, **Then** the system returns to idle state silently without generating spurious text
2. **Given** I'm using the system continuously for 2+ hours, **When** I perform transcriptions of varying lengths, **Then** the system maintains consistent performance without degradation or crashes
3. **Given** I'm having an intermittent conversation with 30-second gaps, **When** I trigger transcription multiple times over 1 hour, **Then** each transcription is processed correctly without state corruption
4. **Given** I speak a 30-second continuous sentence, **When** the system processes this long audio, **Then** transcription completes successfully without timeouts or errors
5. **Given** I trigger transcription 50+ times in a session, **When** the system processes each request, **Then** no memory leaks or resource exhaustion occurs
6. **Given** background noise is present, **When** I accidentally trigger without speaking, **Then** the system filters noise and does not produce repeated word artifacts

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the transcription model encounters memory pressure after extended use?
- How does system handle rapid successive triggers (stress testing)?
- What occurs during very short audio clips (< 0.5 seconds)?
- How does system recover from internal component failures?
- What happens when system resources are constrained?
- How does system handle various audio quality conditions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST operate continuously for 4+ hours without crashes or memory leaks
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle transcription requests ranging from 0.1 seconds to 5+ minutes without failure
- **FR-003**: System MUST return to idle state within 2 seconds of completing any transcription operation
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter background noise and prevent generation of repetitive text artifacts ("okay okay okay")
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect and recover from internal component failures automatically
- **FR-006**: System MUST process at least 100 transcription requests per session without degradation
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain response time under 500ms for hotkey activation/deactivation
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear status indicators (idle/recording/processing) that accurately reflect current state
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle interruptions (rapid key presses, overlapping requests) gracefully
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent stuck processing states through timeout mechanisms and state validation
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate all internal state transitions and prevent invalid state combinations
- **FR-012**: System MUST log sufficient diagnostic information for troubleshooting without impacting performance

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Transcription accuracy MUST remain consistent (>95%) throughout extended sessions
- **PR-002**: Memory usage MUST remain stable (< 1GB growth per hour of operation)
- **PR-003**: CPU usage MUST not exceed 80% sustained during normal operation
- **PR-004**: System MUST complete 90% of transcriptions within 3 seconds of audio completion

### Reliability Requirements
- **RR-001**: System MUST have 99.9% uptime during intended usage sessions
- **RR-002**: System MUST recover from 100% of known error conditions without user intervention
- **RR-003**: System MUST prevent data corruption or loss under all failure scenarios
- **RR-004**: System MUST maintain operation despite individual component failures through redundancy

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Audio Session**: Represents a complete usage period with multiple transcription requests, maintains state and performance metrics
- **Transcription Request**: Individual audio processing operation with timing, quality, and error tracking
- **System State**: Current operational status (idle/recording/processing) with validation and transition logging
- **Error Recovery Context**: Information needed to restore system to functional state after failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time monitoring data for session health and degradation detection

- [x] **Self-Correcting Intelligence**: Continuous learning system that adapts to user vocabulary and patterns
- [x] **Enhanced State Management**: Proper error handling with auto-recovery from stuck states
- [x] **Quality Monitoring**: Real-time transcription quality analysis and improvement suggestions
- [x] **Diagnostic Tools**: Comprehensive troubleshooting utilities (debug_hang_issue.py, force_cleanup.py)
- [x] **Visual Indicator Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of persistent notifications and stuck "listening" states
- [x] **Smart Text Formatting**: Intelligent formatting with pause detection and context awareness
- [x] **Hotkey System Fixes**: Enhanced hotkey handling with tail-end buffer support
- [x] **ModernWhisperASR**: Simple, persistent model loading (loads once, uses 100+ times)
- [x] **Extended Stability**: 4+ hour operation with intermittent usage patterns
- [x] **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Systematic validation preventing "okay okay okay" hallucinations
- [x] **Constitutional Framework**: Updated development principles based on real-world lessons

### Critical Lessons Learned:
1. **Aggressive Model Reloading Destroys Performance**: The original system reloaded every 2 transcriptions
2. **Simpler Solutions Work Better**: Over-engineered stability systems introduced more bugs
3. **Research Current Practices**: 2024 implementations use persistent models, not frequent reloading
4. **Measure Before Optimizing**: Assumptions about "stability" led to performance destruction
5. **Graceful Degradation Beats Crashes**: NullWhisperModel fallback prevents service interruption
6. **Preserve-Then-Replace Prevents Outages**: Build new before destroying old avoids model gaps
7. **Systematic Validation Prevents Corruption**: Buffer protection must be integrated, not bypassed
8. **UI State Management Needs Timers**: Auto-reset prevents stuck states better than manual tracking
9. **Event-Driven Beats Polling**: Explicit key tracking eliminates transient state detection

### Performance Improvements:
- **Transcription Speed**: Achieved 70x realtime with WhisperX (vs 10-15x with standard Whisper)
- **Intelligence Layer**: Added self-correction without impacting performance
- **Model Loading**: Reduced from every 2 calls to every 100 calls (50x reduction)
- **Session Duration**: Extended from 2 minutes to 4+ hours (120x increase)
- **Quality Monitoring**: Real-time analysis with learning and adaptation
- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced state management with automatic recovery
- **User Experience**: Professional-grade transcription with context awareness
