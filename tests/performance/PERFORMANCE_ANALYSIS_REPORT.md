- **Memory**: Gradual accumulation over time
- **Reliability**: Good initially, degrades over session

### Balanced Configuration (Recommended)
- **Model reload frequency**: Every 5 transcriptions
- **Some optimizations enabled**: Memory pooling, chunked processing
- **Expected performance**: 80% of original speed, 95% of current stability

### GPU Optimized Configuration
- **Device**: CUDA with float16
- **Expected speed**: 5-10x realtime consistently
- **Stability risk**: GPU-specific issues, but faster recovery
- **Memory usage**: Higher GPU memory consumption

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor production usage** - Validate stability improvements in real-world scenarios
2. **User experience testing** - Ensure reload delays are acceptable
3. **Performance baseline tracking** - Establish metrics for ongoing monitoring

### Optimization Opportunities

2. **GPU fallback option** - Enable GPU with aggressive fallback to CPU
3. **Smart preloading** - Prepare next model during idle periods
4. **Selective optimizations** - Re-enable safe performance features

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Model upgrade path** - Test with newer Whisper models
2. **Hardware scaling** - Evaluate dedicated transcription hardware
3. **Caching strategies** - Cache model states for faster reloads
4. **Quality vs. speed tuning** - Fine-tune parameters based on usage patterns
