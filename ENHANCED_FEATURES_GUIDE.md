# Enhanced VoiceFlow - Complete Wispr Flow Alternative with Advanced Personalization

## üéâ Major Enhancements Completed (v1.2.1)

VoiceFlow has been completely enhanced to match and exceed Wispr Flow functionality with true global voice transcription capabilities, now featuring a powerful personalization engine.

### ‚úÖ Core Improvements Implemented

1.  **Fixed Global Hotkey**: Changed from `Ctrl+Alt` to `Ctrl+Alt+Space` (Wispr Flow compatible, configurable).
2.  **Robust Text Injection**: Multi-method universal text injection across all Windows applications.
3.  **Unified Architecture**: Three deployment modes for different use cases.
4.  **MCP Integration**: Full integration with Claude MCP ecosystem.
5.  **AI Enhancement**: Context-aware text formatting via Ollama/DeepSeek.
6.  **System Tray Operation**: Invisible background service like Wispr Flow.
7.  **‚ú® NEW: Personalization Engine (`python/personalizer.py`)**:
    *   **Custom Vocabulary**: Significantly improves recognition accuracy for user-specific terms, names, brands, and acronyms by providing hints to the Whisper model. Managed via `~/.voiceflow/personal_dictionary.csv`.
    *   **User-Defined Formatting Rules**: Allows fine-grained control over the final transcribed text using custom regex rules applied *after* AI enhancement. Managed via `~/.voiceflow/user_formatting_rules.csv`.
    *   **Basic Voice Commands**: Support for commands like "new line", "new paragraph", and "scratch that" to control transcription output directly via voice.

üéØ Key Features
Global Voice Transcription
Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+Space (configurable in enhanced_settings.json)
Universal: Works in ANY Windows application
Instant: Text appears immediately at cursor position
Context-Aware: Adapts AI formatting based on active application (e.g., email, chat, code).
AI Enhancement
DeepSeek Integration: Via Ollama for intelligent text formatting.
Context-Specific Prompts: Different AI instructions for email vs chat vs code contexts.
Real-time: Processing in 1-3 seconds.
Fallback: Basic formatting if AI unavailable.
‚ú® NEW: Personalization Engine (python/personalizer.py)
VoiceFlow now includes a powerful personalization layer that works in conjunction with AI enhancement:

Custom Vocabulary (personal_dictionary.csv):

Location: C:\Users\{Username}\.voiceflow\personal_dictionary.csv
Format: CSV file. Each row is an entry.
YourTerm (single column): Adds "YourTerm" to Whisper's initial prompt to improve recognition.
SpokenForm,WrittenForm: Also adds "WrittenForm" to the prompt. (Future versions might use SpokenForm for more direct mapping).
Purpose: Helps Whisper correctly identify and transcribe words or phrases it might otherwise miss or get wrong (e.g., unique names, technical jargon, acronyms).
User-Defined Formatting Rules (user_formatting_rules.csv):

Location: C:\Users\{Username}\.voiceflow\user_formatting_rules.csv
Format: CSV file. Each row is Pattern,Replacement,ContextPattern.
Pattern: Regular expression to search for in the text (after AI enhancement).
Replacement: String to replace the matched pattern. Can use regex capture groups (e.g., \1).
ContextPattern (Optional): Regular expression to match against the detected application context string (e.g., email, code.exe, chat). If blank, the rule applies in all contexts.
Example Rules:
call with (.*),meeting with \1,email (Changes "call with John" to "meeting with John" only in emails).
ASAP,as soon as possible, (Applies globally).
(^|\s)ok(\s|$),OK, (Changes standalone "ok" to "OK" globally, respecting word boundaries).
Purpose: Provides granular control over the final text output, allowing for specific substitutions, corrections, or stylistic adjustments.
Basic Voice Commands:

Detection: Processed from raw transcribed text before AI enhancement or formatting rules.
Supported Commands (case-insensitive):
new line: Injects a newline character (\n).
new paragraph: Injects two newline characters (\n\n).
scratch that: Signals the application to attempt to delete the previously transcribed/injected segment (actual deletion depends on main app integration and capabilities).
Purpose: Allows for quick, hands-free editing and formatting during dictation.
Text Injection Methods
(No change to this section)

Application Context Detection
(No change to this section, but personalizer.py's rules can use the detected context)

üìã Installation & Setup
(No change to prerequisites or setup steps, but users should be aware of the new CSV files for personalization)

To use personalization features:

After running VoiceFlow once, a ~/.voiceflow/ directory will be created if it doesn't exist.
Inside this directory, you can create:
personal_dictionary.csv
user_formatting_rules.csv
Populate these files according to the formats described above. Changes are typically loaded when VoiceFlow starts.
üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions
(Basic transcription usage is the same. Voice commands are new.)

Using Voice Commands
Simply say the command phrase clearly, e.g., "new line".
The command will be processed, and the corresponding action taken (e.g., a newline inserted, or for "scratch that", an attempt to delete previous text).
Command phrases themselves are not typed out.
(Context-Aware Examples and MCP Integration Usage sections remain relevant.)

üîß Configuration
(The enhanced_settings.json is still relevant for general settings. The new personalization features are configured via their respective CSV files.)

Personalization Configuration Files:
Custom Vocabulary: C:\Users\{Username}\.voiceflow\personal_dictionary.csv
User Formatting Rules: C:\Users\{Username}\.voiceflow\user_formatting_rules.csv
(Existing enhanced_settings.json details remain relevant.)

üìä Performance Metrics
(Personalization features, especially dictionary, aim to improve accuracy and relevance. Formatting rules add minimal overhead. Voice commands are processed quickly.)

üö® Troubleshooting
New: Personalization Not Working
File Location: Ensure personal_dictionary.csv and user_formatting_rules.csv are in the correct directory: C:\Users\{Username}\.voiceflow\.
File Format: Check that the CSV files are plain text and correctly formatted (commas separating fields, one rule/entry per line).
Logs: Run VoiceFlow in a console/debug mode. The personalizer.py module prints messages when loading dictionaries/rules, including errors for invalid regex patterns in rules.
CSV Encoding: Ensure files are UTF-8 encoded, especially if using special characters.
Regex Syntax: Double-check your regex patterns in user_formatting_rules.csv. Online regex testers can be helpful.
(Other troubleshooting points remain relevant.)

üîÑ Comparison with Wispr Flow
(The new personalization features further enhance VoiceFlow's customization capabilities beyond Wispr Flow.)

Feature	Wispr Flow	Enhanced VoiceFlow (v1.2.1)
... (existing comparisons) ...		
Custom Vocabulary	Limited/None	Yes (via CSV, influences Whisper prompt)
User Rules	Limited/None	Yes (Regex-based, context-aware, via CSV)
Voice Commands	Basic	Yes (Basic commands like "new line", "scratch that")
üéØ Advanced Features
(The Personalization Engine is a new advanced feature.)

üöÄ Future Enhancements (Roadmap Updated)
Phase 1 (Next Release - v1.3.0)
Full Integration of Personalization: Ensure personalizer.py capabilities are robustly integrated and utilized by all relevant VoiceFlow execution modes (Enhanced launchers, MCP server).
UI for Personalization: A simple settings panel or utility to manage personal_dictionary.csv and user_formatting_rules.csv more easily than manual CSV editing.
"Scratch That" Refinement: Improve the reliability and behavior of the "scratch that" command, possibly by tracking recently injected text segments.
Auto-start with Windows (from previous roadmap)
Performance optimizations (from previous roadmap)
Phase 2 (v1.3.x / v1.4.0)
Advanced Voice Commands: Expand command set (e.g., "delete last word", "capitalize selection", application-specific commands).
Dynamic Reloading: Allow reloading personalization files without restarting VoiceFlow.
Model Persistence (from previous roadmap)
Custom Hotkeys (from previous roadmap)
Audio Device Selection (from previous roadmap)
Phase 3 (Future)
User-Specific AI Fine-tuning Hints: Explore ways to more deeply adapt the local AI formatter based on user corrections or style (beyond current prompting).
Mobile app integration (from previous roadmap)
Team collaboration features (from previous roadmap)
Real-time translation (from previous roadmap)
(Items like "Custom vocabulary training" from the old roadmap are now superseded or partially addressed by the personal_dictionary.csv approach.)
