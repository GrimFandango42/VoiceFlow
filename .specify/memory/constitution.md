# VoiceFlow Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Architecture
Every feature MUST leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities for superior transcription quality. Use state-of-the-art models (Whisper V3 Turbo, WhisperX) with advanced features including word-level timestamps, speaker diarization, and context awareness. Intelligent processing through smart chunking, VAD preprocessing, and forced alignment is required. Performance optimization via batched inference, GPU acceleration, and memory efficiency is mandatory.

**Rationale**: VoiceFlow is fundamentally an AI transcription system. Subpar AI capabilities compromise the entire product value proposition.

### II. Performance Through Persistence
Expensive resources MUST be loaded once and kept in memory for repeated use. Model persistence is required - load Whisper models once, use for 100+ transcriptions. Simple locks around model access are preferred over complex pooling. Resource monitoring is essential but avoid over-optimization. Graceful degradation MUST handle errors without destroying working state.

**Rationale**: Model reloading is expensive (2-10 seconds) and destroys user experience. Modern faster-whisper implementations are designed for persistence.

### III. Practical-First Development
Working solutions MUST be implemented first, then optimized. Direct fixes for specific user issues take precedence over theoretical edge cases. Real-world testing with actual usage patterns is required over synthetic scenarios. User experience optimization for what users actually need and notice is mandatory.

**Rationale**: Complex architectures often introduce bugs while solving problems users don't have. Simple, working solutions provide immediate value.

### IV. Production-Ready Defaults
Systems MUST be designed for 24/7 operation with intermittent usage from day one. Support patterns from 0.5s commands to 5-minute speeches. Maintain stable memory usage over hours/days. Handle failures gracefully without user intervention. Error recovery and auto-restart mechanisms are required.

**Rationale**: VoiceFlow runs continuously in the background. Systems that fail during extended operation are unusable for real users.

### V. Evidence-Based Optimization
All changes MUST be based on measurement and research, not assumptions. Benchmark before changes to establish baseline metrics. Research current best practices and production implementations. Profile real usage under actual conditions. Validate improvements through testing and benchmarks. Document lessons learned.

**Rationale**: Assumptions about performance and user needs frequently prove wrong. Measurement prevents performance regressions and ensures optimizations actually improve user experience.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- Type hints required for all Python functions and parameters
- Error handling MUST include specific exception types, never generic Exception
- Input validation required for all user-facing interfaces
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys - use environment variables
- Follow existing code patterns and style within modules

### Testing Requirements
- Test real-world scenarios with purpose-built tools rather than abstract frameworks
- Performance validation through benchmarking before and after changes
- User experience testing to validate fixes solve actual user issues
- Diagnostic tools for specific problem debugging over generic test suites
- Extended period testing (30+ minutes minimum) for stability validation

### Documentation Standards
- Implementation evidence required for all constitutional principles
- Working code examples for complex features
- Troubleshooting guides for known issues
- Performance metrics and benchmarks documented
- Clear setup and usage instructions

## Quality Assurance

### Performance Standards
- 70x realtime transcription speed minimum using WhisperX
- First transcription completion within 5 seconds of audio end
- No audio cutoff at beginning or end of speech
- Model loading time under 10 seconds on typical hardware
- Consistent performance between first and subsequent transcriptions

### Reliability Standards
- 24/7 operation capability with automatic error recovery
- Memory stability over extended periods (hours/days)
- Graceful handling of rapid successive operations
- Recovery from component failures without user intervention
- State management preventing stuck or hung states

### User Experience Standards
- Instant response to hotkey activation/deactivation
- Clear visual feedback for all system states
- Quality insights and improvement suggestions
- Seamless operation across different speech patterns and lengths
- Professional-grade accuracy (95%+ in typical conditions)

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution amendments require:
1. Performance benchmarking showing improvement or no regression
2. Implementation evidence demonstrating viability
3. Documentation of lessons learned
4. Validation through real-world testing
5. Update of dependent templates and documentation

### Compliance Requirements
All development MUST verify constitutional compliance before implementation. Performance regressions require constitutional justification. Complex solutions MUST justify deviation from practical-first principles. Evidence-based decision making is mandatory for all architectural choices.

### Version Management
Constitution follows semantic versioning:
- MAJOR: Backward incompatible principle changes
- MINOR: New principles or material expansions
- PATCH: Clarifications and refinements
