Quick test to verify the buffer accumulation fix works correctly.
This reproduces the exact issue you reported:

Before fix:
Recording 1: "okay, so we're getting closer..."
Recording 2: "okay, so we're getting closer...so yeah, it is working well"  
Recording 3: "okay, so we're getting closer...so yeah, it is working well...new content"

After fix:  
Recording 1: "okay, so we're getting closer..."
Recording 2: "so yeah, it is working well"
Recording 3: "new content"
