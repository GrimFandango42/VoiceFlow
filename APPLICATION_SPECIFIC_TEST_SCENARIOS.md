# Application-Specific Test Scenarios
## ðŸŽ¯ Confidence-Based Testing for Your Windows Environment

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **HIGH CONFIDENCE (95%+)** - Start Here

### **VSCode Development Workflow**
**My Confidence**: 95% - Text editors are ideal for voice transcription

#### **Scenario A: Python Development**
```python
# Place cursor here and dictate:
# "Create a function that processes user data from the database"

def process_user_data():
    """
    Function that processes user data from the database
    """
    pass
```

**Test Script**:
1. Open VSCode with a `.py` file
2. Place cursor in different locations:
   - Inside function definitions
   - In comments
   - In docstrings
   - At file top level
3. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and dictate the comment above
4. **Expected**: Clean, properly formatted text

#### **Scenario B: JavaScript/TypeScript Development**
```javascript
// Dictate: "This function handles user authentication with JWT tokens"
function authenticateUser(token) {
    // Dictate: "Validate the token and return user data"
    return null;
}
```

**Advanced Tests**:
- Technical terms: "async await", "REST API", "microservices"
- Code structure: "arrow function", "destructuring", "async function"

---

### **Notepad Text Entry**
**My Confidence**: 98% - Simplest possible integration

#### **Scenario A: Basic Text**
```
Dictate: "Today I tested the voice transcription system and it worked perfectly. The accuracy was approximately 95 percent, which exceeds my expectations for this type of technology."
```

#### **Scenario B: Technical Documentation**
```
Dictate: "To install the package, run pip install voice-flow in your command prompt. Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system."
```

**Test Variations**:
- Numbers: "123", "version 2.5", "25 percent"
- Punctuation: periods, commas, question marks
- Special terms: file paths, commands, URLs

---

### **Browser Text Fields**
**My Confidence**: 90% - Standard web forms work reliably

#### **Scenario A: Gmail Compose**
1. Open Gmail, click "Compose"
2. Click in subject line
3. Dictate: "Meeting notes from today's standup"
4. Click in body
5. Dictate: "Here are the key action items from our discussion today. First, we need to update the database schema. Second, the API documentation needs revision."

#### **Scenario B: GitHub Issues/PRs**
1. Navigate to any GitHub repository
2. Click "New Issue" or comment on existing issue
3. Dictate: "This feature request adds voice transcription capabilities to improve developer productivity and accessibility."

**Cross-Browser Testing**:
- Chrome/Edge: Should work perfectly
- Firefox: Should work well
- Safari: May have minor differences

---

## ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (80-90%)** - Proceed with Caution

### **Command Prompt Operations**
**My Confidence**: 85% - Terminal apps can be finicky

#### **Scenario A: Git Commands**
```cmd
# Dictate these commands one by one:
git add -A
git commit -m "Added voice transcription feature"
git push origin main
```

#### **Scenario B: File Operations**
```cmd
# Test these commands:
cd Documents
dir *.txt
copy file1.txt backup.txt
```

**Potential Issues**:
- Some terminals don't support clipboard injection
- Special characters (quotes, dashes) might need verification
- Test both `cmd` and PowerShell

**Workaround Strategy**:
If direct injection fails, the text should go to clipboard for manual paste

---

### **PowerShell Scripting**
**My Confidence**: 82% - PowerShell has better clipboard support

#### **Scenario A: Basic PowerShell**
```powershell
# Dictate:
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Projects" -Recurse -Include "*.py"
Set-Location "C:\AI_Projects\VoiceFlow"
```

#### **Scenario B: Complex Commands**
```powershell
# Dictate:
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.WorkingSet -gt 100MB} | Sort-Object WorkingSet -Descending
```

---

### **Cloud Code Environment**
**My Confidence**: 82% - Cloud environments vary

#### **Scenario A: In-Browser Cloud Code**
1. Open Google Cloud Code in browser
2. Navigate to a source file
3. Test dictating:
   - Function comments
   - Variable declarations
   - Import statements

#### **Scenario B: Desktop Cloud Code**
- Similar tests as browser version
- May have better integration
- Test with different project types

**Known Challenges**:
- Network latency might affect responsiveness
- Security restrictions in cloud environments
- Different behavior across cloud providers

---

## ðŸ”´ **LOWER CONFIDENCE (60-80%)** - Test Carefully

### **Microsoft Office Applications**
**My Confidence**: 70% - Complex applications with their own text systems

#### **Scenario A: Microsoft Word**
1. Open Word document
2. Test dictation in:
   - Main document body
   - Comments
   - Headers/footers
   - Text boxes

#### **Scenario B: Excel**
1. Open Excel spreadsheet
2. Test in:
   - Individual cells
   - Formula bar
   - Cell comments
   - Chart titles

**Expected Limitations**:
- Rich text formatting may not be preserved
- Some UI elements may not accept text injection
- Excel formulas might need manual adjustment

---

### **Specialized IDEs**
**My Confidence**: 65% - Varies greatly by IDE

#### **Scenario A: Visual Studio (Full)**
- Test in code editor
- Test in immediate window
- Test in solution explorer search

#### **Scenario B: JetBrains IDEs**
- IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm
- Test in editor and search fields
- May have custom text handling

---

## ðŸ§ª **Critical Edge Case Testing**

### **Multi-Application Workflow**
Test the scenarios that caused previous failures:

#### **Test 1: Application Switching**
1. Start recording in VSCode
2. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and begin speaking
3. Alt+Tab to Notepad while still holding buttons
4. Finish sentence and release
5. **Expected**: Text appears in Notepad (final focused app)

#### **Test 2: Rapid Start/Stop**
1. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` for 1 second, release
2. Immediately hold again for 2 seconds, release
3. Repeat 5 times rapidly
4. **Expected**: No crashes, system remains responsive

#### **Test 3: Very Long Dictation**
1. Hold `Ctrl+Shift` and speak continuously for 45+ seconds
2. Include pauses, "um", background noise
3. **Expected**: Graceful handling, no memory issues

#### **Test 4: Resource Competition**
1. Open 10+ applications
2. Start large file download or system update
3. Test voice transcription under load
4. **Expected**: Slower but functional performance
